Hi! im Ven,
 I mainly use github as a collection of scripts i've made in mainly Rust, maybe a little bit of Python and SQL Mapping later on in the future.
 I also use Ubuntu Budgie as my OS of choice, Sublime as my favored IDE, with the trusty terminal to test, compile, and run all of my scripts.
 Horchata, Nicotine, and Coding are the 3 things that keep me alive.
